# Elist Ecommerce Performance Report

## Client Background
Founded in 2018, Elist Electronics is an online retailer that sells popular electronics worldwide via its website and mobile app. The business relies on digital marketing channels (email, SEO, affiliates) to grow sales, especially for Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad products. This analysis uses Elist’s transactional and customer data to evaluate growth, product performance, loyalty program impact, and refund behavior.
In this project, I focus on total revenue, orders, average order value (AOV), refund rate, and loyalty-driven sales as the key measures of Elist’s commercial performance.
